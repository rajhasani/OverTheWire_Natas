Start by heading over to natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org. We're given the username and password to be "natas0".

Upon logging in, we're given our first instructions:

***You can find the password for the next level on this page.***  

I don't see anything on the page itself, so let's check the HTML. Right-click and "View Page Source", or hit Ctrl+U. 

Towards the bottom of the HTML, we see a comment:

*`<!--The password for natas1 is g9D9cREhslqBKtcA2uocGHPfMZVzeFK6 -->`*
