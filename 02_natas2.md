***There is nothing on this page ***

There really isn't... or is there? Upon viewing the HTML source, we see that there is an image on the page: a pixel, located at files/pixel.png. Let's head over to the /files/ directory:

**`http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/`**  

Here we see two files: pixel.png, and a new one called users.txt. Let's take a peek in there:
