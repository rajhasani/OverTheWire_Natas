This repo is a level-by-level write-up of OverTheWire's Natas wargame, which is intended to be an elementary introduction to basic serverside web security.

The guide and instructions for each level can be accessed at https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/

Unlike the previous wargames (e.g. Bandit, Krypton, Leviathan), there is no SSH login to access the wargame; simply head to the URL provided for each level and input the username/password to access the level. The syntax for the levels you are are attempting to access is `natasx.natas.labs.overthewire.org`; for example, to access natas4, head over to `natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org`.

### The filenames in this guide directly pertain to the level you are on. Example: 04_natas4.md is a guide for which you are currently on natas4, attempting to access natas5.

Syntax for command I/O is as follows:

* All input commands will be in **`bolded code span`**  
* All output from commands will be either in
  * *`italicized code span`* OR
  * 
  ``` 
  fenced
  code 
  blocks 
  ```

It is worth noting that items like passwords and RSA keys are subject to change at OverTheWire's sole discretion. The passwords displayed in this guide will be current as the time of publication. I will NOT be revisiting/revising the guide to update passwords and RSA keys; however, the overall process will remain unchanged.
